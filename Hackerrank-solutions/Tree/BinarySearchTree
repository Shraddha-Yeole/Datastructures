/* Code pair Problem:
Each node of a Binary Search Tree (BST) has an integer value and pointers to as many as two children. The children of a parent node are referred to as the left child and the right child. The value of left child is always less than the value of its parent node, and the value of right child is always greater than or equal to the value of its parent node.
 
Function Description
Complete the isPresent function in your editor below.  It should return 1 if the value is present int the BST, or 0 if it's not.
 
isPresent has the following parameters:
- root: reference to the root node of a BST 
- val: the integer value to search for
 
Constraints
1 ≤ total nodes ≤ 105
1 ≤ val ≤ 5 × 104
Input Format for Custom Testing
Input from stdin will be processed as follows and passed to the function:
 
Each line contains an integer to search for in the given BST.

Explanation
Value: 30. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 10. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 12. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 15. This value is not present in the BST, so isPresent returns 0.

Explanation
Value: 79. This value is not present in the BST, so isPresent returns 0.
Value: 10. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 20. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 30. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
Value: 40. This value is present in the BST, so isPresent returns 1.
