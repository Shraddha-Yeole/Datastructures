/* You are given an array of integers and must compute the maximum difference between any item and any lower indexed smaller item for all the possible pairs, i.e., for a given array a find the maximum value of a[j] - a[i] for all i, j where 0 ≤ i < j < n and a[i] < a[j].

Function Description

Explanation

n = 7, a = [2, 3, 10, 2, 4, 8, 1]

 

Differences are calculated as:

3 - [2] = [1]
10 - [3, 2] = [7, 8]
4 - [2, 3, 2] = [2, 1, 2]
8 - [4, 2, 3, 2] = [4, 6, 5, 6]
 

The maximum is found at 10 - 2 = 8. */
