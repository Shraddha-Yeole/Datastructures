/* Count pairs from two BSTs whose sum is equal to a given value x
Given two BSTs containing n1 and n2 distinct nodes respectively. Given a value x. The problem is to count all pairs from both the BSTs whose sum is equal to x.

Examples:

Input : BST 1:    5        
                /   \      
               3     7      
              / \   / \    
             2  4  6   8   

        BST 2:    10        
                /   \      
               6     15      
              / \   /  \    
             3  8  11  18
        x = 16
    
Output : 3
The pairs are:
(5, 11), (6, 10) and (8, 8) */
