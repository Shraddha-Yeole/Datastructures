/* Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. For example, if the given number is 6, output should be 2 as there are two set bits in it.

Input:

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The next T lines will contain an integer N.

Output:
Corresponding to each test case, in a new line, print count of set bits in it.

Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 100

1 ≤ N ≤ 1000000


Example:

Input:

2
6
11
 

Output:
2
3 */
